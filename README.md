php-skeleton-library
====================

Skeleton for PHP library projects

This is my personal PHP library skeleton for use with Composer. Use it or don't, improve it or not, do whatever you like, but P/R your changes if they're interesting :p

## Use

```shell
composer create-project aztech/php-skeleton-library <target-dir>
```
